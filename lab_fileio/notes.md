part 2 of the challenge doesn't make any sense, it refers to a csv file created in the first step when there wasn't one, I think it means the one created earlier in the labs after reviewing the solution.

1. Create a text file with a list of directory names, one per line, similar to `users.txt` but make up your own data. Write a program that accepts a filename as a command line argument. Have the program:

   - read the filename passed as an argument
   - open the file
   - read each directory name and create a directory
   - test the program until it reads the input file and creates the desired
     directories

2. Write a program that reads the bayareatemps.csv file into a dictionary [use the Python csv module object designed
   for this purpose], and print out the data in the file. Yes, this is very similar to what we did earlier in the lab...just try to do this without looking at this earlier code.
